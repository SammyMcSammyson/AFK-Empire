This is our Project it will go really well.

As a user, I want to sign up and log in securely using Clerk so that I can interact with the app as a user on the site .

As a player, I want my counter to increase when I click the attack button and decrease when I buy items so that I can track my progress and manage my resources effectively.

As a player, I want my health and DPS to change based on the items I buy from the shop, so that I can strengthen my character for tougher battles.

As a player, I want to customize my profile by picking an avatar, updating my bio, and viewing my current items and stats, so that I can personalize my experience and track my progress.

As a player, I want to buy and sell items in the shop to improve my stats, so that I can enhance my gameplay and progress in the dungeon.

As a player, I want to engage in combat with enemies in the dungeon, where I can earn rewards on success or return to the landing page on failure so that I can experience progression and consequences in the game.

As a user, I want an enhanced user experience with modern UI components, such as using a Radix UI Primitive or a similar library, so that the interface is more intuitive and visually appealing.
